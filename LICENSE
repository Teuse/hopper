HOPPER LICENSE

This is the normal Vim license (see ':h license' in Vim) with the necessary
replacements for the project and maintainer information.

I)  There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of hopper
    except that they must include this license text.  You can also distribute
    unmodified parts of hopper, likewise unrestricted except that they must
    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables
    that you made from the unmodified hopper sources, plus your own usage
    examples and scripts.

II) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of hopper,
    including executables and/or source code, when the following four
    conditions are met:
    1) This license text must be included unmodified.
    2) The modified hopper must be distributed in one of the following five ways:
       a) If you make changes to hopper yourself, you must clearly describe in
          the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you
          (in any way) for a copy of the modified hopper you distributed, you
          must make your changes, including source code, available to the
          maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to
          include your changes in the official version of hopper.  What the
          maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they
          will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation
          then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.
          The current maintainer is Jan Larres <jan@majutsushi.net>.  If this
          changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
          majutsushi.github.io/hopper and/or github.com/majutsushi/hopper).
          When it is completely impossible to contact the maintainer, the
          obligation to send him your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has
          confirmed that he has received your changes they will not have to be
          sent again.
       b) If you have received a modified hopper that was distributed as
          mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it
          unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the
          text under a) applies to those changes.
       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of
          the modified hopper you distribute.  This may be done in the form of
          a context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you
          add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from
          making their own changes to the official version of hopper.
       d) When you have a modified hopper which includes changes as mentioned
          under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the
          changes if the following three conditions are met:
          - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
            the changes to the hopper maintainer without fee or restriction, and
            permits the hopper maintainer to include the changes in the official
            version of hopper without fee or restriction.
          - You keep the changes for at least three years after last
            distributing the corresponding modified hopper.  When the
            maintainer or someone who you distributed the modified hopper to
            asks you (in any way) for the changes within this period, you must
            make them available to him.
          - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This
            contact information must remain valid for at least three years
            after last distributing the corresponding modified hopper, or as
            long as possible.
       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,
          you can distribute the modified hopper under the GNU GPL version 2
          or any later version.
    3) A message must be added, at least in the documentation, such that the
       user of the modified hopper is able to see that it was modified.  When
       distributing as mentioned under 2)e) adding the message is only
       required for as far as this does not conflict with the license used for
       the changes.
    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make
       corrections.

III) If you distribute a modified version of hopper, you are encouraged to use
     the hopper license for your changes and make them available to the
     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is
     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL. If
     the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a
     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is
     <jan@majutsushi.net>

IV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the
     hopper sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this
     license for previous hopper releases instead of the license that they
     came with, at your option.
